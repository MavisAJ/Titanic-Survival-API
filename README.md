# Titanic-Survival-API(Using FASTAPI)
The pupose of this project is to build an API (using FastAPI) which is able to interact with a machine learning model that is able to predict rightly the possibility of a passenger on the Titanic ship surviving.
The train and test dataset as well as the submision file containing the predictions of the model are all included in this repo.
